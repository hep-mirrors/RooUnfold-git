RooUnfold: ROOT Unfolding Framework
===

RooUnfold is a framework for unfolding (AKA "deconvolution" or
"unsmearing").  It can be used from the ROOT prompt, or compiled and
linked against the ROOT libraries.  It currently implements seven
methods:

  - iterative ("Bayesian");
  - singular value decomposition ([SVD](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9509307), as proposed by Höcker and Kartvelishvili and implemented in [TSVDUnfold](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTSVDUnfold.html));
  - bin-by-bin (simple correction factors);
  - an interface to the [TUnfold](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTUnfold.html) method developed by Stefan Schmitt
  - simple inversion of the response matrix without regularisation
  - iterative dynamically stabilized (IDS) unfolding
  - usage of gaussian processes (GP) for regularizing a kernel, as developed by Adam Bosson
  - Poisson unfolding, a simple likelihood unfolding

RooUnfold was originally written by Tim Adye, Richard Claridge,
Kerstin Tackmann, and Fergus Wilson (2007). It has since received
contributions from many others.  It is currently maintained by Tim
Adye, Carsten Burgard, Lydia Brenner, and Vincent Croft. If you have
any additional methods, please contact us under [our support mailing
list](mailto:roounfold-support@cern.ch).

Building the Library
---

RooUnfold uses [ROOT](https://root.cern.ch/). The ROOT web site has [instructions](https://root.cern/install/)
for installing ROOT on different systems in various ways.
In particular, ROOT is already installed on [CERN
lxplus](https://lxplusdoc.web.cern.ch/). Alternatively, if you have
[CVMFS](https://cernvm.cern.ch/fs/), it is available using, eg. for
EL9 (Redhat, Alma, Rocky, etc.):
```
source /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/views/LCG_106a/x86_64-el9-gcc14-opt/setup.sh
```
Check out RooUnfold

    git clone ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999/RooUnfold/RooUnfold.git
    cd RooUnfold

Build with `cmake`, using

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make -j4
    cd ..
    source build/setup.sh

Or using [conda](https://root.cern/install/#conda) after activating
a conda environment and checking out RooUnfold:
```
conda install root cmake
```

Build with `cmake`, using

    mkdir build-conda
    cd build-conda
    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${CONDA_PREFIX} -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmake/conda-toolchain.cmake ..
    make -j4 install

For backwards compatibility, we also maintain a GNU `Makefile`.

Usage
---

Example usage instructions as well as a more detailed description and
recommendations can be found in the [User Guide](https://gitlab.cern.ch/RooUnfold/documentation/-/blob/master/RooUnfold_user_guide.pdf).

Versions
---

Many versions of RooUnfold are tagged, you can access them after with
`git checkout X.Y.Z` after cloning the repository.  The following list
contains some of the major milestone versions.

  - 3.0.0: Inclusion of RooFit, transition to RooFitUnfold.
  - 2.0.0: General interface improvements
  - 1.1.1: Legacy port from SVN repository
